# Machine-Learning

Andrew Ng's Machine Learning courses in Coursera

### Implement the following eight assignments with matlab:
1. Implement linear regression and get to see it work on data. 

2. Implement logistic regression and apply it to two different datasets.

3. Implement one-vs-all logistic regression and neural networks to recognize hand-written digits.

4. Implement the backpropagation algorithm for neural networks and apply it to the task of hand-written digit recognition.

5. Implement regularized linear regression and use it to study models with different bias-variance properties.

6. Use support vector machines (SVMs) to build a spam classifier.

7. Implement the K-means clustering algorithm and apply it to compress an image.

8. Implement the anomaly detection algorithm and apply it to detect failing servers on a network.
